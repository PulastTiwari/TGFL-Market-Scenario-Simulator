# Contributing to TGFL Market Scenario Simulator

Thank you for your interest in contributing! To keep contributions consistent and high-quality, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository and open a pull request against `main`.
2. Run unit tests locally and ensure new code includes tests for new behavior.
3. Keep changes small and focused; one PR per logical change.
4. Follow the project's code style and formatting (black/flake8 encouraged).
5. For changes that affect public APIs (modules, function signatures, CLI), include a short note in the PR description.
6. Include rationale and test steps in the PR description.

If you're unsure where to start, check the `issues` tab for good first issues.
